# Fuji Sunset

Spent a good chunk of the afternoon WFH (Working From Hammock) on the forbidden part of the roof so I could keep an eye on Fuji. You know, to make sure it didn't go anywhere or anything.

It's hard to get a good photo of Fuji during the day. It just fades into the blue of the sky and the white of the clouds. Even when I know it's there, I question my sanity. 

> Is that really Fuji? Or just a cloud? It's way higher than all those other mountains... 

Then on the clearest of days, or at sunset, I am reminded: Fuji is way higher than all those other mountains.
