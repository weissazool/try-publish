This seems to be part of a complex of several temples, all of which have un (cloud, é›²) in their name. I've passed by the main temple many times before, but this was the first time I had realized that there were more temples behind it in back alleys.

There's this greenway which I've been walking up and down these days. Mostly to get out of the house and get some exercise. It used to be a river. Apparently, [there's a lot of smaller waterways that have been undergrounded in Tokyo](https://thetokyofiles.com/2016/01/17/walking-on-water-the-underground-rivers-of-tokyo/). I'd like to run it. I think it's probably about 3km long. But it has narrow pathways and steps and little playground areas, so I end up running along roads that parallel it instead. On one of those parallel roads, I came across the alley that led me here.

Writing this, I was listening to a binaural recording from [a site describing a weeklong hike in Mie](https://walkkumano.com/iseji/) and felt a terrible longing for the sound and smell of waves.
