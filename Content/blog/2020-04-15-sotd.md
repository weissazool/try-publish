# Sakuragaike Fud≈ç-in

That day I went to Heiwanomori to check on the grassy space there. They had cut down a lot of the trees and replaced them with a water feature and a turf field. Selfishly, I'm OK with the turf field. The field also had a couple of nets that I could throw a frisbee at... were they not completely monopolized by a bunch of kids playing soccer. Still, it seemed like a good place where I could do some solo throwing.

Too bad it was closed a few days later for the state of emergency.
