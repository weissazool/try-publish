# Finally deployed!

Well, this is now available in a public space. Not that anyone will bother reading it. That said, I subscribe to friends' (very infrequently updated) blogs via RSS and read everything they post. That's actually my preferred way of keeping up with people... because social media is terrible. 

That said, the RSS feed doesn't seem to be working very well at the moment. I'll get to it eventually, if anyone actually complains to me about it. My first priority though is to improve the design (CSS, eek) first in order to make this look a bit less generic.
