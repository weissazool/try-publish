For these giant gateways, the gods pass over, not through.

I'm curious. What might the cumulative value of the real estate of the shrines and temples in the Tokyo metropolitan area be? We could work out a rough estimate by average value of a square meter of land multiplied by the actual land area of the temples and shrines. I wonder if we could get a rough idea of what that land area was via some mapping API. Google's map API is now "Google Maps Platform" and has testimonials by Allstate, so that's right out. It seems like the [Overpass API for OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) could be useful though.
