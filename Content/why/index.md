# Why

## Why does this site exist?

### Learning

I used to play around with Jekyll to generate static sites from Markdown. I probably have a few public repositories of
these here and there.

Unfortunately, it felt hard to justify time and effort working with Jekyll, since it was so different from what I did
on a day-to-day basis. Although I must note that learning a templating tool (Liquid) has come in handy when using
SwiftGen. At any rate, generating static sites from Swift will allow me to play with something that is more relevant to
what I want to be doing work-wise, so, two birds with one stone.

### Fun

I miss writing!
