# SOTD

Shrine of the day. Which is a misnomer, since there may be temples as well. I am not distinguishing between 神社 and 寺 for this exercise.

If I can think of a better name, I'll update it. Daily Religious Structure is terrifying. Today's Temple sounds preachy. Ideas welcome.

My goal is for this to:

- Give me a writing topic.
- Force me to delve into my backlog of photos for source material, since I doubt I will be able to take the time every day to go out and find a new shrine.
