# SOTD

Shrine of the day. Which is a misnomer, since there may be temples as well. I am not distinguishing between 神社 and 寺 for this exercise.

If I can think of a better name, I'll update it. Daily Religious Structure is terrifying. Today's Temple sounds preachy. Ideas welcome.

Things this project gives me:

- Writing prompts.
- Incentive to delve into and enjoy my backlog of photos while looking for source material.
