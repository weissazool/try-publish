I took a photo of the sakura tree next door every day for a month.

I've been doing this for a few years now, although I usually would miss days here and there. This has been the most consistent year so far. It probably worked out this year because I was just at home the whole time, and this would give me at least some reason to step outside for a bit.

I decided to try putting together all the live photo videos. The quality is... not high, but you can still see the transformation. I think there are a couple of issues - the live photos themselves are not as high quality as the photos themselves, plus, it seems like a lot of compression happened between exporting the video and uploading it to Youtube.

Maybe one year I'll do a time-lapse video... who knows. 

It was fun to mess around with iMovie again. I actually have another project I'd like to do with that. We'll see how it goes.
